" Vim is based on Vi. Setting `nocompatible` switches from the default
" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
" configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).
set nocompatible

" Turn on syntax highlighting.
syntax enable

" Disable sound and visual bell because they are annoying
set belloff=all

" Enable mouse support. You should avoid relying on this too much, but it can
" sometimes be convenient.
set mouse+=a

" Disable the default Vim startup message.
set shortmess+=I

" Show line numbers and relative numbers.
set number
set relativenumber

" Always show the status line at the bottom, even if you only have one window open.
set laststatus=2

" The backspace key has slightly unintuitive behavior by default. For example,
" by default, you can't backspace before the insertion point set with 'i'.
" This configuration makes backspace behave more reasonably, in that you can
" backspace over anything.
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" Allow pasting content from other applications
set clipboard+=unnamed,unnamedplus

" By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
" shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "
" forgetting about unsaved changes and then quitting e.g. via `:qa!`. We find
" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
" for more information on this.
set hidden

" keep 200 lines of command line history
set history=200

" show the cursor position all the time
set ruler

" display incomplete commands
set showcmd

" display completion matches in a status line

" time out for key codes
set ttimeout

" wait up to 100ms after Esc for special key
set ttimeoutlen=100

" Change behaviors of indentation
set shiftwidth=4
set tabstop=4
set expandtab
set autoindent
set smartindent

" Show a few lines of context around the cursor. Note that this makes the
" text scroll if you mouse-click near the start or end of the window.
set scrolloff=5

" Do incremental searching.
set incsearch

" Don't use Q for Ex mode, use it for formatting.  Except for Select mode.
" Revert with ":unmap Q".
map Q gq
sunmap Q

" Do not recognize octal numbers for Ctrl-A and Ctrl-X, most users find it
" confusing.
set nrformats-=octal

" Try to prevent bad habits like using the arrow keys for movement. This is
" not the only possible bad habit. For example, holding down the h/j/k/l keys
" for movement, rather than using more efficient movement commands, is also a
" bad habit. The former is enforceable through a .vimrc, while we don't know
" how to prevent the latter.
" Do this in normal mode...

nnoremap <Right> :echoe "Use l"<CR>
nnoremap <Up>    :echoe "Use k"<CR>
